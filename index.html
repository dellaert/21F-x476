</h3>
<p>This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals of image formation, camera imaging
        geometry, image processing, convolutional neural networks and deep learning, feature detection and matching,
        image alignment, motion estimation, structure from motion, SLAM, and stereo. The focus of the course is to
        develop the intuitions and mathematics of the methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between
        theory and practice in the projects.</p>
