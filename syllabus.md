## Syllabus

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:
1. Recognize and describe both the theoretical and practical aspects of computing with images. Connect issues from Computer Vision to Human Vision
2. Describe the foundation of image formation and image analysis. Understand the basics of 2D and 3D Computer Vision.
3. Become familiar with the major technical approaches involved in computer vision. Describe various methods used for registration, alignment, and matching in images.
4. Get an exposure to advanced concepts, including state of the art deep learning architectures, in all aspects of computer vision.
5. Build computer vision applications with python and the pytorch framework.

### Prerequisites
No prior experience with computer vision is assumed, although previous knowledge of visual computing or signal processing will be helpful. The following skills are necessary for this class:
* Data structures: You'll be writing code that builds representations of images, features, and geometric constructions.
* Programming: Projects are to be completed and graded in Python. All project starter code will be in Python. TA's will support questions about Python. If you've never used Python that is OK, as long as you have programming experience.
* Math: Linear algebra, vector calculus, and probability. Linear algebra is the most important and students who have not taken a linear algebra course have struggled in the past.

### Grading
This project is heavily project-based, but there will be graded quizzes administered through canvas. The grading distribution is:

| Component     | Nr. | Grade | Total |
|---------------|-----|-------|-------|
| Project 0     |     | 4%    |  4%   |
| Projects      |  6  | 12%   |  72%  |
| Quizzes       |  6  | 4%    |  24%  |
|---------------|-----|-------|-------|
|               |     |       | 100%  |

Late policy for this course will be 10% per day late, as discussed on the first day of class and clarified on Piazza.

### Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. This includes cheating, lying about course matters, plagiarism, or helping others commit a violation of the Honor Code. Plagiarism includes reproducing the words of others without both the use of quotation marks and citation. Students are reminded of the obligations and expectations associated with the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code and Student Code of Conduct, available online at www.honor.gatech.edu.

You are expected to implement the core components of each project on your own, but the extra credit opportunities often build on third party data sets or code. That's fine. Feel free to include results built on other software, as long as you are clear in your handin that it is not your own work.

You should not view or edit anyone else's code. You should not post code to Piazza, except for starter code / helper code that isn't related to the core project.

<h3>Course Attendance:</h3>
<p>Class sessions for CS x476 will take place remote but **synchronously**. You are strongly encouraged to attend class during the assigned class times (Tuesday and Thursday, 3.30pm-4.45pm) and re-review the video snippets when they become available.</p>

### Contact Info and Office Hours:
If possible, please use Piazza to ask questions and seek clarifications before emailing the instructor or staff.

### Acknowledgements
The materials from this class rely significantly on slides prepared by other instructors, especially James Hays, Derek Hoiem, Svetlana Lazebnik, and Judy Hoffmann. Each slide set and assignment contains acknowledgements. Feel free to use these slides for academic or research purposes, but please maintain all acknowledgements.

## Covid 19 Information

The fall semester 2021 is especially challenging due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Even though CS x476 will be taught remotely, please take note of the information below. &nbsp;The most up-to-date information on Covid-19 is on the </span><a href="https://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus">TECH Moving Forward</a><span> website.

We encourage everyone in the Georgia Tech community to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendations, vaccinate, and wear a mask in campus buildings. 

If there is one thing each one of us can do to protect ourselves and keep others safe, it is to get vaccinated. The new vaccines have proven to be extraordinarily effective at preventing severe illness. Getting vaccinated at Georgia Tech is easy and free. If you choose not to get vaccinated, you are encouraged wear a mask in indoor public places, including campus buildings, as recommended by the CDC. 

The CDC recently issued new interim guidance recommending the use of masks inside public buildings even by fully vaccinated individuals. At Georgia Tech, everyone is encouraged to wear a mask or face covering while inside campus facilities. To be clear, neither vaccination nor masking in indoor public spaces is required at Georgia Tech.  

The free asymptomatic surveillance testing program remains available to all students and employees. You may participate in regular testing even if you have been fully vaccinated. We especially encourage those who have not been vaccinated to get tested weekly.
